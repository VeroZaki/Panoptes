# Panoptes
## Abstract
During the past recent years, the rate of crime, especially theft, is in continuous and noticeable 
increase which has alerted the majority of countries to find more available ways to control this 
increasing crime rate. Countries’ authorities always encourage their citizens to install surveillance 
cameras to help them through criminals’ capture and to spread the feeling of safety and security 
on the streets. 
Surveillance cameras have benefited from the advances in machine learning and deep learning to 
enhance their existing features and to include new advanced features that years ago would have 
been impossible. Although the surveillance cameras footage is being monitored by security 
members and shop owners, it would be faster and more efficient for these devices to be able to 
take their actions on their own. The project introduces a method for cameras that use computer 
vision technology and deep learning algorithms to detect actions such as shop theft. Through image 
processing and analysis, the system extracts features from the frames captured by the surveillance 
cameras and according to the situation, specific actions will be taken. 
Our project is named Panoptes after the many-eyed giant in Greek mythology which is known for 
having the saying “followed by the eyes of Argus”. The name Panoptes has been an inspiration for 
us as Argus Panoptes is considered the eye that sees and notices everything in its surroundings. 
Hence, our project Panoptes is the camera system that follows and identifies the “wrong” actions.
